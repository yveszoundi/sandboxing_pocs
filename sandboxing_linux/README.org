#+TITLE: TODO

This will likely be about =seccomp= and =landlock=. I don't think that =landlock= is available on most Linux distributions though.

I might need to think about potential fallbacks to =SELinux= or =AppArmor= as =landlock= availability is not guaranteed
 - Linux distribution specific for default installation
 - Users can build their own custom kernels, they can disable =SELinux= and so on...
